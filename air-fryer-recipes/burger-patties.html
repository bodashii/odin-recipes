          Form beef into 4 patties, approximately 3/4 inches thick and 4 1/2
          inches in diameter. Make the patties slightly bigger than the buns to
          allow shrinkage.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whisk together warm melted butter and beef soup base in a small bowl.
          Brush lightly onto both sides of patties and season with pepper. Set
          patties into the air fryer basket. Depending on the size of your air
          fryer, you may need to cook them in batches.
        </p>

        <p>
          Air-fry patties for 7 minutes, flipping halfway through, for medium
          doneness. For well done, air-fry for an additional 2 minutes.
